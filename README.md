# jekyll-base
It's Glenn's Jekyll test site - welcome!

Hello all - I'm new to Jekyll and new to static sites. This is just a (ridiculously) modest place for me to learn a bit about both.

I used the "Deploy to Netlify" button on StaticGen.com to create this repository and the pages are generated and hosted on Netlify.

The URL for the site is: http://jekyll.zucman.com

Thanks for visiting! Have a pleasant day!
