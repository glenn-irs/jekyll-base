This is my 1st post for Jekyll!

I'm writing in **Markdown** in *Github*... I think! :)
Let's see if I can make this page go!

I tried 3 new platforms today: Jekyll, Muse & Joomla.

* **Jekyll:** You're looking at it!
* **Muse:** [zucman.com/muse](http://zucman.com/muse)
* **Joomla:** [beacharts.ca/summer](http://beacharts.ca/summer)

I'm excited to see what all 3 can do.

* **Jekyll:** Static Web + Markdown + Github + Netlify
* **Muse:** Looks like it might be the best path to my *Cornell box in cyberspace*
* **Joomla:** Some say it has a lot of the ease of WordPress w a lot of the power of Drupal

This is a really simple, clean page. Just words and images. No twitter feeds, sidebar widgets, etc. It's a lot of what I like about Ghost. Editing **Markdown** here in *Github* really isn't bad at all. Or you could use a dual view editor on Win/Mac, like:

**Win Markdown Editor**

**Mac Markdown Editor**
http://macdown.uranusjr.com

**Mac-Win-Lin Markdown Editor**
https://typora.io
