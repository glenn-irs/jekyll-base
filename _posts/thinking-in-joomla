I'm not sure I'm capable of writing this article ATM, since I'm only starting to *Think in Joomla,* but it is interesting to realize that it's a somewhat different cognitive space than WordPress was. I've spent a half-dozen years now mostly working in WordPress. It's fantastic. A couple weeks ago I decided to try making a Joomla site. It's frustrating because it seems to work *similarly* to WordPress, but different. The differences begin mostly as frustrations because you can't, or don't know how, to do what you want. But slowly as you begin to make sense of how **Modules, Menus** and other aspects of Joomla work, you start to move from frustration to empowerment. 

But more than empowerment, the differences between Joomla & familiar WordPress seem to be invitations or opportunities to think differently about how you organize and present content.

## Learning Joomla

1. I'm lost, Modules & Menus are weird, why is it so complicated?
2. Oh wow, this is a lot more flexible!
3. Oh, it's not just more flexible, it's kind of a different way of thinking.

Note that this all feeds through **Theme Flexibility** (can use multiple, customize by menu item)

Is **Activities** vs **Optional Meetups** really a different way of thinking? You could have done the same in WP! **But.** Joomla plus this nice theme seem to invite you to think or organize this way, and the theme layout can customize for each item. Ultimately I think it's part the flexibility of Joomla, part the value of this very simple, very visual template, and part just that being a bit disoriented is also an invitation to think about what you're organizing and how you're presenting it.
