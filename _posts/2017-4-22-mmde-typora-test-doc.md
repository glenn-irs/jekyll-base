## What About Spell Check?
So what if you are typing about some kerfuffle the other day and you possibly mikspell a word... ooo... spellcheck! (actually, what amazes me **more** than *Minimalist Markdown Editor* having Spellcheck, is that I somehow managed to spell *kerfuffle* correctly the first try! (IDK it even was a "real" work... "real" - hahaha...))

## Weirdly
So MMDE seems to do what I want: Markdown + Spellcheck. But somehow I'm not feeling the symbiosis I feel with the Ghost Editor, or even with the Github editor. IDK why. It definitely works. But... hmm...

![Australian Ballet photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glenn-irs/jekyll-base/master/_images/Campaign%20for%20The%20Australian%20Ballet%2C%202015%20by%20Ren%20Pidgeon.jpg)
*Campaign for The Australian Ballet, by Ren Pidgeon*

Huh... I wonder why the image is rendering as a broken link here in MMDE? I imagine the page will work when deployed, but it should render in the preview pane too, no?

Oh well...

> It's always something!

I just pasted this content in Ghost and it previews fine. Although to some degree you're benefited by it *not* previewing in that it keeps the Markdown & Preview panes in sync. When Ghost or other Markdown Editors do preview images, the panes get out of sync which is sort of a pain.

So I guess it can still be MMDE FTW. Just double check your images.

This is a nice (reasonable) place to type.

## 3 Options

There's 3 tools that seem to work pretty well on both Mac & Win, and have Spellcheck



* Typora - doesn't preview images
* Minimalist Markdown Editor - doesn't preview images
* Ghost - does preview images (but not ideal to upload 2 github, or course)

(oh, and when it's in Github, the images do preview)

## Favorites this minute
So I guess these are my current favorite ways to type (M/W)

1. Typora
1. Ghost
1. MMDE
1. GitHub Editor

They're all fine. Except no **spellcheck** in Github editor.

I'm not thrilled with the no spellcheck, but at least you can write in Typora which is a nice experience, and then you can edit the files right here in GitHub Markdown, which **works** *nicely!*

## Markdown Headspace
It's weird that all the big php CMS' don't (natively) support Markdown: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal - *no gots!*

Ghost is (awesome) native Markdown. But Ghost is nodeJS, so the PHP CMS' / PHP MySQL engines, hating-on-MD streak is unbroken. 

By contrast, the Static / Flat web world seems to live on Markdown. Jekyll which powers this GitHub site, and a couple dozen others all seem to be native Markdown.

> **Why** is Markdown so shunned in the PHP/CMS world, and so embraced in the Static/Flat world??
