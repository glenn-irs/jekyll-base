## Yen Li & Maggie 

Yen Li & Maggie spent the summer of 2015 working as lifeguards at YMCA of the Rockies, in Estes Park, Colorado. At the end of the summer they did some travelling before going home to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. After a summer of hardcore American food, they were ecstatic to visit *888 Seafood* in Rosemead, CA and have a great *Hong Kong style Dim Sum Breakfast*.

## Valley Blvd

After breakfast we drove down Valley Blvd in what I used to call "Rosemead & San Gabriel." Yen Li & Maggie were both amazed at all the Chinese signs lining the street. Maggie said that it was like they were in Taipei. 

Ever since that day I've called the *Rosemead-San Gabriel* area ***New Taipei.*** (even though the many dim sum places here are "Hong Kong style", and the servers speak Cantonese)

## It's about the food!

Like all Jane's Walks, this *Jane's Walk New Taipei* is completely free and open to all. There's no purchase necessary of course,  but this stretch of Valley Blvd in New Taipei has so many Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean food places, you should probably bring at least a little appetite.

If anyone wants to try something along the way we can stop and try. Our two official stops are *dim sum breakfast* at the East End of New Taipei at **888 Seafood** and *boba & pastries* for a mid-day walking snack at **Bake Code** on the West End of New Taipei.

If you want to have breakfast, meet at 888 Seafood at 10am. If you want to just walk, meet at 888 Seafood at 11am.
